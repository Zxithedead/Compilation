The Prison Cat by Selenia
~In memory of Bleys and Sybille, my nice Mice~

There once was a king, and a queen. They governed a small kingdom in a large prison cell. It was all they could ever wanted between 4 walls. It should be said, that although small, this cell was lushed with resources. One could find anything they ever wanted, should they look hard enough. Of course, some people prefered to look for an escape. That was probably the only thing one couldn't quite find. 

One day, a Cockroach approached the King's court, and warned them of a menace. The Cat. Now, the king and queen knew the Cat very well. They'd often scritched its back and got scritched right back. But they did not know the Cockroach... and frankly, who would want to? And so they sent it out. It went out with dignity, for it knew that it was a strong insect, capable of surviving in the worst conditions. But it was, in the end, no match for the Cat. 

Weeks pass, and the Cat would still visit the King and Queen's domain, take in some of their food, and wines. Frankly, they were quite happy without seeing the Cockroach around. But as the Cat slept, the nice Mice sneaked in to speak with the Queen. The Cat will eat us all as well they claimed. But the Queen didn't believe it, after all, the Cat was eating their food. And there was so much more to find around. Why would it bother with the nice Mice? But that was the last time they ever saw the nice Mice.

It's not like they had any real problem with the Cat, but they quite liked to nice Mice. So when the scary Dog came to visit, they asked it, could you take care of the Cat for us? The Dog had known of the Cockroach, and the nice Mice. But even the Dog did not want to help. He wasn't scared of the Cat, but this was not his fight. This was their Cat problem. They resolve to deal with it themselves, for if not even the scary Dog would help, who could?

The next time the animal came around, they had the wine poisoned. The Cat dranked it all, and got woozy. The king and queen went for his side with their daggers but... It was still not enough. The Cat had gotten too large, too fat. Stab it as they might, they could not breach its skin. When the Cat finally woke up from all the jabbing, and ate them. And then the Cat killed the Dog as well. He feasted on his success for weeks. 

Then the Cat was alone. The prison still had everything one could ever want, should they look hard enough. But the Cat was not one to look hard enough. The lush forestry, the fields of food... Everything perished, without all the other beings there to feed it. The Cat started looking for an escape, the one thing that should have been impossible to find... but as with all things one find, it is always the last thing someone finds. The Cat started eating itself. 
The End.

The sound of knocking wakes me up in a shiver. My hyper alerted mind raced with sudden possibilities in a gasp. Thunder echoed in the rain outside. Was it only the storm, trees banging on windows? No, still the knocking went on and on, coming from the door downstairs. Who would be outside in such a tempest? Who could be? The cold bites as soon I stand up to sit on the side of the bed, hair and skin raised while the wood shook and groaned. "There's someone at the door," I whispered, shaking my husband to wake him up. "Mhm," he replies with. Could it be the neighbor? Are they in trouble? I find my coat, blindly reaching in the darkness, helped only by crashing lightning. 

Rain on the ceiling accompanies my steps to the stairs. Leaves rushing through the wind join the moaning steps as I look toward the front door. As lightning strikes, I see a shadow under the door. The knocking hasn't stopped, it's only gotten louder. It's all I can hear as I reach it. The doorhandle rattles even before my hand extend to it. I hold back. Do I want to open this door? Who would even be outside at a time like this? I should get my husband at least, drag him if I have to. I look back and I see his shape above the steps. He's nodding his head, going down the stairs slowly.

As my hand settle on the doorknob, it stops shaking. The knocking stops. The wooden floor is wet around the door. I realized I've been holding my breath. I open the door quickly. It's my husband, drenched from head to toes. "WE’RE NOT ALONE,” he yells in a panic, trying to drag me away. I resist in stunned confusion. My husband was upstairs? The footsteps on the steps accelerate as he comes down the stairs. Scared thoughts provide too slow of a reaction. I glance back just in time to see a glinting blade, and a crazed smile spreading on twisted lips as it penetrates my eye.
