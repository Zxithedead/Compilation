The Prison Cat by Selenia
~In memory of Bleys and Sybille, my nice Mice~

There once was a king, and a queen. They governed a small kingdom in a large prison cell. It was all they could ever wanted between 4 walls. It should be said, that although small, this cell was lushed with resources. One could find anything they ever wanted, should they look hard enough. Of course, some people prefered to look for an escape. That was probably the only thing one couldn't quite find. 

One day, a Cockroach approached the King's court, and warned them of a menace. The Cat. Now, the king and queen knew the Cat very well. They'd often scritched its back and got scritched right back. But they did not know the Cockroach... and frankly, who would want to? And so they sent it out. It went out with dignity, for it knew that it was a strong insect, capable of surviving in the worst conditions. But it was, in the end, no match for the Cat. 

Weeks pass, and the Cat would still visit the King and Queen's domain, take in some of their food, and wines. Frankly, they were quite happy without seeing the Cockroach around. But as the Cat slept, the nice Mice sneaked in to speak with the Queen. The Cat will eat us all as well they claimed. But the Queen didn't believe it, after all, the Cat was eating their food. And there was so much more to find around. Why would it bother with the nice Mice? But that was the last time they ever saw the nice Mice.

It's not like they had any real problem with the Cat, but they quite liked to nice Mice. So when the scary Dog came to visit, they asked it, could you take care of the Cat for us? The Dog had known of the Cockroach, and the nice Mice. But even the Dog did not want to help. He wasn't scared of the Cat, but this was not his fight. This was their Cat problem. They resolve to deal with it themselves, for if not even the scary Dog would help, who could?

The next time the animal came around, they had the wine poisoned. The Cat dranked it all, and got woozy. The king and queen went for his side with their daggers but... It was still not enough. The Cat had gotten too large, too fat. Stab it as they might, they could not breach its skin. When the Cat finally woke up from all the jabbing, and ate them. And then the Cat killed the Dog as well. He feasted on his success for weeks. 

Then the Cat was alone. The prison still had everything one could ever want, should they look hard enough. But the Cat was not one to look hard enough. The lush forestry, the fields of food... Everything perished, without all the other beings there to feed it. The Cat started looking for an escape, the one thing that should have been impossible to find... but as with all things one find, it is always the last thing someone finds. The Cat started eating itself. 
The End.
