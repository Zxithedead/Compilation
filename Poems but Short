I watch her grace everyday,
A sweet and loving display,
But this I cannot convey,
She is not mine to sway.

How could one fancy to conjure an idea so delusional... the fantasy in imagination it takes to conceive such spectacular nightmare. Quite the pipe dream to daydream a dream in which stealing from the dreamer doesn't haunt every conceivable, imaginable, and believable sleeping moments. 

Nightmare unending will track you awake unrelenting. For what is truly hope to the forever dreamless? Awakened fury will trail you through reverie unfinished. For what may be safe when sleep is no escape? Before it's too late remember, do not wake the dreamer.

The aroma of sweet intensity cascades upward through curious breath. An idea of taste, the tale to follow.
Fire erupts at the first touch of fiery adventure, fragrant waterfall follows the chute of burning passion. 
The anatomy shivers and bends, letting its moan share the appreciation of liveliness. 
As it slips, only the abstract dream of the flow is left, and the musing to sip anew the muse.

Hitting the facade of conversation, cold tête-à-tête outraged in heat rage. Clenched pair of fangs and daggereous eyes refusing to move back or fly forward. Daring each selves to achieve forevermore pain. Two winners in the game of losing, walking in opposite directions.

Broken by joy,
Saddened by bliss 
The whole of one's world in the hand. 
A comforting heartbreak
Melancholy so poignant it delights in euphoria.
A dreamer's dream dreamed
