Exhaustion, Distress and Restlessness
Feebled eyes rises expended to new mass of sand dunes defying your crestfallen disheartened bones insubmissive. Debilitating lassitude collapses in your fatigue lungs, consuming what insufficient breath may yet wind up there. Limbs tremble harshly in hostility to carry, resisting any further request to climb any farther. the lazy desire to express themselves. The remaining body now a lethargic gear grinded to apathetic dullness, wearily hoping to reach comatose nooks of resistance but finding only expected absence, familiar disappointement. 

The sand shifts and burns at your engulfing unmovable feet. You sink deeper into the flaming liquid rocks. You  abandon all aching ambition apace from anguished misery mixed melancholy in swarming grief. Your body is barely your own anymore, it dreams of the smallest movement. But dreams are not enough. Darkness becomes consummately impatient as you drown thoroughly. Breathing is an impossible concept you've not witnessed in years.  Panic sets in with this realisation. But panic is more than enough.

Jittery insomnia awakens all unrestful bustle that fermented deep within. The intensity of action ignites such starlit sun, the urgency emergency of movement an impossibility to resist. The mere suggestion of questioning this explosive outburst blasts shockwave of denial. You awake cascading out of the sand, glaring at the puny dunes in your path. Wondering why you ever felt any concerned.

Longing, Desire, Rage by Selenia
Thicket of past destiny flash wildly around yourself as crawling legs fight the aphotic swamp. The out of hand-reach lights sail shine the beauty of nostalgia, the unique delicacy of time lost adrift now behind you like forgotten dreams. Distressing in movement, locked knees sinking as your gaze aims backward. 

Your heart twist from inside the outside, but inside and out. How unfair the fairness of it all. The complete inequality of desire, left to be desired. Silence burns thicker than fire. Hate grows from nothing for sudden everything.

A quiet rage, bubbling under the quagmire. A pristine zeroed noise, beyond the potential of any other sound, chased away by the loudness intensity speechless. The noise of quiet echoes destroying all. An unheard commotion roaring away all reality. A ringing of absence simply remains - lost in translation.

Ocean of Betrayal by Selenia
Swirling raining pain torrent itself on crouched bundled misty eyes deluged me. To feel so personaly alone, so untrustworthy companionless. Only me and my vacuity in the crying ocean of tears, a solitary beach of woeful velvet gripped by unaided forsaken lonesome. From counting raindrops to getting taken by the waves. Are words from strangers all it takes? 

A growing echoing nothing sprouts the chasmal abyss from a newly formed pit down my sunken throat. Emptiness so vastly vacant, so unlimitedly unfilled, it is more than the lack of substance. It is concreteness in weighted void. A growing fissure, a hole where the heart should be. It multiplies with unshed tears, flourishing with unsaid words, thriving under lack of expressing. 

And then you are only the abysm, the gorging gorge of grief, a gulf of gloominess growing giant. So large you cannot hold it, or let it go. Collapsing on yourself, turning inward to the unfeeling sensation of feeling unparalleled, sinking into oceans of depths through depressed declines. Crushed downcast descending downwards into darkness so dark one forgets the sound of light. When will I finally touch the seabed?

That Moment by Selenia
Colluding complicity meeting in an intrusive look. Silver-tongued silence talks in tactile movements. Thundering hearts echoes in vast small distance. Frightening exhiliration feeling wonderful fears. Closing meaningful expanse with skin-touched desired. Melting glaciers meet in hungry embrace. Craving layers fall yearningly in rushing soft-clothed voraciousness. Exposed shyness humbled by blushing confidence. 

Biting breath joins dancing speech in-depth. Matched languished anatomy discover deep personal connections. Grasping grip hold and explore hook in excess extremity. Silicitous souls eagerly touches earnest essence fervently. Mutual intimity tenderly penetrates affections. An abundant trust thrust itself lavishly. Candid velocity intuitively floods voluntarily increasingly swiftly. Moaning pleasure richly sing its all consuming feelings. Crescending love upsurge surges to ascending climax peaking the zenith as it crest the pinnacle of culmination.

Transported by Selenia
Awaken from deep sleeping by the hollow sensation of own guts gently getting ripped out, a dull pull toward every singular direction simultaneously. Spinning as if standing still, there's a thrumming sound just outside your stirred consciousness. Like noiseless winds surging past your face without piercing by flowing through, without awareness to perceiving responsiveness.

You'd be fear-stricken if you were but further aware, you'd be forever blind if your gaze could stare at any vision ovserved by hostaged optics. An annoyed delight to never experience it's knowing dynamic.

The reverie leads to cold reality as if by omission. The delusion makes room for solid burning desert. A memory forgotten, a nightmare no better than what's being dreamed.

Transported in a painful, unfeeling kind of way. Afraid to know and dying to.
